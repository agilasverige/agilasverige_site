Story: Attendant signs up for conference

  As a prospective attendant
  I want to signup for the conference
  So that the organizers know I am coming 
  
  Scenario: signing up with all needed fields
    When prospective attendant is on signup page
    Then he can see fields for first_name, last_name, email, telephone_number, company, street_address, zipcode, postal_address and country
    When he signs up with all fields
    Then a new attendant is created
    
  Scenario: Signing up with taken email address
    Given an attendant is already registered with email 'ema@il.com'
    When a prospective client signs up with email 'ema@il.com'
    Then he is redirected to '/attendants/new'
    And he gets an info message saying 'redan registrerad'
